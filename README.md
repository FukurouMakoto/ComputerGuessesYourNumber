# ComputerGuessesYourNumber
Really proud of this program. Made it as a way to practice the quick sort algorithm. 
Using the quick sort algorithm, this program guesses your number within six attempts on average.

### How to use
1) Clone repo
2) run main.py

### Future changes
Will clean up the code to proper functional syntax.
